            <p class="intro">
                There is a lot of hype and misconceptions surrounding machine learning (ML). 
                You might have heard that advanced mathematics is a requirement for ML, 
                or you need to be an expert programmer to start writing ML code. 
                <br><br>
                Well, I can tell you that these are just peopleâ€™s opinions, and the thing 
                holding back those interested in ML is their will to dive right in and gain 
                first hand experience coding different ML algorithms.
                <br><br>
                As a beginner, the only requirement and the first step to ML is undoubtedly 
                the desire and will-power to search through loads of introductory content 
                in ML, and absorbing what they have to offer. Although, with a stupendous 
                amount of content and books being published in this field, it might 
                require you to become a good researcher, and find content that best 
                introduces different concepts for you. That is why I have decided to write 
                this beginner-friendly, non-technical introduction to machine learning. Note, 
                The best way to learn is to apply what you learn in hands-on projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="assumptions">
                I must acknowledge that, the mathematical concepts and principles powering 
                different ML algorithms are indeed complex. As such, to understand how these 
                algorithms function at a deeper level will demand that one brushes of on 
                some topics in mathematics and statistics. 
                <br><br>
                In this piece, the focus is getting the absolute beginner up to speed with what
                ML is all about, and not so much on the math behind different algorithms, or how 
                they work. These advanced topics are covered in other posts. However, to get any 
                value from this article, some basic knowledge of statistics
                and programming is assumed.
                <br><br>
                If you are an absolute beginner in programming but interested in ML, first get a 
                good grasp of the basics such as data types, conditional statements and loops. 
                Also, learn python for Data Science and ML from the following articles.
                <br><br>
                <li><a href="">Introduction to python for absolute beginners interested in AI or Web Development</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Python for Data Science and Machine Learning in 2022: For beginners</a></li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>So, what is ML?</h3>
            <br>
            <p style="background-color: rgb(243, 243, 247);; padding: 10px 10px; border-radius: 14px;"><span>
                In simple terms, machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence 
                where computers are trained with significant amounts of data to make smart 
                decisions resembling human behavior, without being explicitly programmed. 
                That is, after training the ML model, evaluating its performance and 
                deploying it to production, it can 
                use new inputs of data to predict some expected outcome without human 
                intervention.
            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The ML model will identify patterns and trends in the data provided and 
                develop a mathematical equation that maps given inputs features, to a 
                target variable.
                <br><br>
                As a beginner, you only need to roughly grasp the ML flow and the 
                different steps in the process and the rest will follow. These steps 
                include: <br><br>
                <li>Problem Definition</li>
                <li>Loading the Data</li>
                <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
                <li>Data Preparation: Biggest part of the DS Process</li>
                <li>Model Selection</li>
                <li>Model Training and Evaluation</li>
                <li>Model Deployment and Monitoring (Operationalization)</li>
                
            </p><br>
            <h4>Problem Definition</h4>
            <p><br>
                The objective of every ML project is to solve a defined problem. 
                Ensuring that the problem at hand is explicitly understood by the project 
                stakeholders is arguably the most important step. Vaguely defining what 
                the objective is and the expected end product is course for failure of 
                any ML project. Defining the target is fundamental to determining when 
                it has been achieved.
                <br><br>
                ML has exceled in many industries, mainly because those involved take their 
                time to define what issues or challenges they aim to address by applying 
                different ML algorithms. The two main problems to explore at this stage 
                are classification and regression problems.
                <br><br>
                <b><i>Classification</i>:</b> Industries all over are successfully applying 
                ML to solve classification problems. For example, many health facilities 
                globally have integrated AI systems in their medical procedures which have 
                yield tremendous benefits and greatly improved patient experience. ML models 
                fed with significant amounts of data have successfully predicted health 
                conditions such as heart attacks, distinguished between cancer cells and 
                healthy body cells etc. In the business context, ML has been used to 
                predict customer churn and detecting fraudulent transactions among other 
                applications. These constitute a classification problem.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, a classification problem is whereby the target variable (outcome) 
                has a limited number of possibilities. Moreover, it can either be binary 
                or multiclass.  A binary classification problem has only two possible outcomes.
                 A financial transaction, for instance, will either be fraudulent or 
                 legitimate.
                <br></br>
                On the other hand, a multiclass classification problem has more than two possible 
                outcomes. In such a problem, a ML model can be trained to identify different types 
                of classes, i.e., fruits, species of plants or animals, or classify different objects 
                in an image. All these are multiclass classification problems.
                <br></br>
                <b><i>Regression</i>:</b> A regression problem is simply where the objective is to 
                predict some numerical variable. Particularly, regression ML models have prevailed 
                in business applications. Businesses that have adopted AI at different levels of 
                their operations have had a superior advantage over those that still rely on legacy methods.
                <br><br>
                Predicting customer demand is notably one of widely used case of ML. Using historical 
                data, companies are applying regression models to paint a picture of what the near 
                future might look like. As such, this has enabled them to plan accordingly and optimize 
                the use of available resources. In the real estate industry, predicting house prices using 
                ML has become an increasingly adopted trend. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, regression ML models are used when the target variable has to be expressed 
                in terms of a numerical value, i.e. price or quantity. 
                <br><br>
                Other use cases of ML exist apart from regression and classification, such as <b>clustering</b>. 
                Where the objective is to segment given observations based on their characteristics. But this 
                is beyond the scope of this piece. For beginners, the focus should be on the two problems defined above.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Loading the Data</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bringing in the data you will be using to train the ML model is a straightforward step. The step will 
                be determined by the model development environment. 
                <br><br>
                The development environment is the software you will use while writing the model code and exploring the 
                dataset you have loaded. If you are already familiar with different development environments, then, bear with me. 
                <br><br>
                In contrast, if you are new to programming and donâ€™t know what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is, 
                and the different options at your disposal, donâ€™t overthink it. Simply put, it is some software that will 
                make your life easier as a developer, compared to writing code in the command line or bash. Microsoft Visual 
                studio, JetBrains PyCharm, Atom and Sublime Text are all examples of IDEs and are some of the popular ones 
                with developers. You should not dwell on selecting one, just do some research and find what you are most 
                comfortable with. In addition to these, there are distributed python environments that come pre-installed 
                with most of the python libraries one needs to develop a ML model end-to-end. 
                <br><br>
                Anaconda is my preferred distributed environment for a complete data science project. It comes with Scikit-Learn 
                which is the most popular ML library and contains different algorithms for both classification and regression. 
                Also, Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization 
                which is vital during EDA. You can achieve a lot with jupyter notebooks in Anaconda, from loading data, exploratory 
                analysis, data transformations and visualization
                <br><br>
                You can install anaconda here
                <br><br>
                Also, explore other options as many good ones are available for free.
                Data is core to any ML project and must be imported before the next step.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                After loading the data, it is paramount that we understand it by examining and summarizing its characteristics, 
                throught exploratory analysis. 
                Think of this as investigating the data.
                <br><br>
                Exploratory analysis involves looking at the data visually and performing some statistical calculations on it, 
                to become aware of what it entails. Such analysis will aid in not only detecting
                 patterns and trends in the data but identifying outliers, anomalies and errors. 
                 In light of this, understanding the data relies heavily on statistics for calculating 
                 values such as the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and percentiles. 
                 Also, looking at the distribution of the features and the target in the data. 
                <br><br>
                The aim of EDA is to paint a picture of the data we are working with, which is 
                integral to choosing different techniques to clean and preprocess the data. A 
                process that must be accomplished before fitting the selected ML model. 
                Furthermore, after you have a good understanding of the data, your model-selection 
                process will be better informed.
                <br><br>EDA guides how you undertake the next step.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Data Preparation: <i>Biggest part of the DS Process</i></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now, I will be quick to tell you that for every ML or Data Science project, 
                preparing the data to feed into the model will take most of the time. Most 
                models have been designed that data used must not have missing values and have 
                to be in numerical form. That is not how the data is in the real world.
                <br><br>
                For example, letâ€™s look at some scenario in the insurance industry. Suppose 
                we are developing intelligent systems for X Insurance Co. that will be able
                 to predict optimal health insurance charges to guide the pricing model. 
                 The data to use will have different features some of which will be 
                 numerical, but others can only be categories. For this case, features 
                 such as the age, body mass index and number of children will be numerical,
                  or can be quantified. But others, such as marital status, whether one is 
                  a smoker, or diabetic can only be classified. For instance, it is â€˜Yes/Noâ€™ 
                  for smoking and similarly one is either â€˜Marriedâ€™ or â€˜Notâ€™. 
                  A ML model would not know how to handle such type of data. It needs to be 
                  encoded first into some numerical format, where numbers will correspond to different categories.
                <br><br>
                Handling missing values is also required. The model will not work with missing 
                entries in the dataset and they have to be first filled with some value. 
                Missing values and categorical data are the two issues you can expect in 
                any ML project and need to know how to handle them, but they are not the 
                only ones. Real world data is messy. There could be inconsistent entries 
                in the dataset, mismatched values, different formats of features, imbalanced 
                datasets and typos are also some of the nightmares to be well equipped to 
                overcome.
                <br></br>
                Fortunately, there exists very gifted and kind people out there that have developed 
                open source code which will enable you to tackle any and every kind of challenge 
                you encounter in preparing your dataset.
                <br><br>
                To understand how to analyze and manipulate your data like a pro, Numpy and Pandas are a must know. 
                Matplotlib and Seaborn are easy to get started with and you can plot lots of graphical 
                representation of your data with just these two. 
                <br><br>
                Data preparation will largely be guided by the ML model you are planning to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Model Selection</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Model selection is easy, when the problem at hand is well defined, its just a matter of 
                choosing between an ever-growing list of machine learning algorithms. 
                <br><br>
                Classification and regression algorithms are easy to implement and interpret. 
                I guess this is where I mention the different types of ML, supervised and 
                unsupervised. There is also reinforcement learning, but this is not for beginners. 
                <br><br>
                <b><i>Supervised</i>: </b>Where the data being used is labeled. These models are trained 
                with input features and their corresponding target values. After, they can be used to make 
                predictions of the target with new input features.
                <br><br>
                <b><i>Unsupervised</i>: </b>These ML models are fed with unlabeled data, and the objective 
                is to group observations with similar characteristics together. More on this on a future post.
                <br><br>
                There are many ML algorithms that have been developed over the years, but some are more 
                popular and preferred in real world cases. Linear regression is among the most used 
                regression algorithms and logistic regression which is for classification problems. 
                Some popular algorithms are applied for both cases, classification and regression. These include:
                <br><br>
                <li>Decision Tree</li>
                <li>Random Forest</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
                <li>K-Nearest Neighbor</li>
                <br>
                Also, there are very powerful algorithms that utilize some advanced techniques known as gradient boosting. They include:
                <br><br>
                <li>XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting)</li>
                <li>Light Gradient Boosting</li>

            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Model Training and Evaluation</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                After the model is selected, training it is a simple matter. Most of the models have the <b>fit()</b> 
                method which is then supplied with the training data, and thatâ€™s it. 
                <br><br>
                Training is where the algorithm used will utilize the mathematical concepts and principles 
                used in its design, to formulate an equation that best represents the relationship 
                between the inputs and the output. The mathematical equation it develops internally 
                maps the features to the target variable. 
                <br><br>
                With the model training complete, it can make predictions of the target variable with new 
                input features, using a <b>predict()</b> method. The predictions made will differ based on 
                the model used and the kind of problem being addressed. Regression algorithms will 
                predict a continuous value for the target, while classification algorithms will predict 
                a class or class probability of the target.  
                <br><br>
                Model predictionâ€™s have to serve the intended purpose, that means asking how good they
                are and whether they provide value. Any model trained on a set of data will make 
                predictions as it was designed to. But sometimes these predictions may be way off 
                from the actual target values, and deploying such as model in a production environment 
                may result to dire costs for a business. As such, the trained model has to be validated. 
                <br><br>
                Validating the model means, assessing how good its predictions for the target are for a 
                set of features it has not considered before. And whether it meets out performance 
                requirements. The evaluation metrics will depend again on the whether itâ€™s a 
                classification or regression problem. 
                <br><br>
                For a <b>classification</b> problem, to validate the model, you have to assess how useful it 
                will be at predicting different classes. There are numerous metrics developed for this 
                task. Some of the metrics to use here are:
                <br> <br>
                <li>Accuracy Score</li>
                <li>Precision</li>
                <li>Recall</li>
                <li>Confusion Matrix</li>
                <br>
                For a regression problem, youâ€™ll have to determine how well the model performs when predicting 
                the continuous target, for a given set of features. Similarly, you can use different metrics here. 
                Some of the metrics at your disposal include:
                <br><br>
                <li>Mean Absolute Error</li>
                <li>Mean Squared Error</li>
                <li>Root Mean Squared Error</li>
                <br>
                In a future post, weâ€™ll fit a model for classification and regression, and use 
                different metrics to evaluate their performance.
                <br><br>
                Now comes the step where ML models are productionized to yield business value
            </p>

            <br>
            <h4>Model Deployment and Monitoring (Operationalization)</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Training a model without deploying it to a production environment is similar 
                to cooking food and not eating it. The whole reason why a model is created in 
                the first place is to use it to make address a defined problem. Therefore, 
                creating it without using it does not make any sense and has no value whatsoever.
                <br><br>
                The manner in which the model is consumed differs from one scenario to another. 
                For instance, a model trained to make predictions on consumer demand can be used 
                once and another one will have to be created as more data comes in. Another one 
                designed to recommend different products to a consumer while browsing through an 
                e-commerce platform will required to make real-time recommendations while they surf.
                <br><br>
                In light of this, the deployment patterns for any ML model is dictated by the problem 
                at hand. However, one model can be deployed in different settings. Therefore, 
                the model deployment pattern will be guided by how the predictions are to be made: 
                Some popular patterns include:
                <br><br>
                <li><b>Offline:</b> Where the model will be used to make predictions on locally</li>
                <li><b>Batch:</b> Here, a model will be used to make predictions on a regular schedule</li>
                <li><b>Real-time or Streaming:</b> Where predictions are made as new inputs come in</li>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now, where does a model live as it is being used? This is dependent on the deployment 
                pattern. <br> <br>
                For instance, one designed to make offline predictions can be stored and used 
                locally, but it depends on the computational requirements. Conversely, a model to make 
                real-time predictions might require significant compute power which most businesses might lack.
                <br><br>
                Well, this is where <b>cloud services</b> come in handy. Technology giants such as Google, Amazon 
                and Microsoft offer storage and compute resources where a business does not have to invest 
                in hardware. These services are managed and require few steps to be set up and utilized. 
                This is a whole new topic to be covered some other time. The idea is that, you do not 
                have to set up your own servers to run models, just look up a preferred cloud services 
                provider and install the model on their servers. 
                <br><br>
                Donâ€™t be bothered by how the model will be utilized if you are just getting started with machine 
                learning. I recommend first you the acquire the skills to create production level 
                code and other good staff like feature engineering, then get acquainted with how to 
                productionize custom ML models. 
                <br><br>
                After you have deployed the model, that is not the end, unless you were doing a one-time, offline 
                prediction thing. How do you ensure that it continues to provide value by making accurate 
                predictions as desired? By monitoring it and retraining it with new data if needed, usually a good practice.
                <br><br>
                <b><i>Monitoring a model is a continuous process. </i></b>
                <br><br>
                Again, with their massive budgets, tech giants have established platforms that have made it seamless to 
                achieve everything you need to have intelligent systems integrated into your systems, and ultimately, culture. 
                Consequently, they provide other services for ML models in production to businesses such as monitoring the model, 
                retraining and model retirement among others.
