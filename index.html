                <p>
                    I'm a Project Manager by profession having secured a Bachelor's 
                    degree in Project Planning and Management back in December 2019.
                    In the contemporary business environment, companies have to 
                    undertake continous product modification and develop new ones as 
                    customer needs and preferences shift. Doing these requires first 
                    defining the objective at hand and the expected deliverables at the 
                    end of any business undertaking. In addition, the resource requirement and utilization
                    have to be effectively strategized or a project may end in total failure.
                    <br><br>
                    Planning is crucial to determining the project timeline, budget, scope and 
                    implementation guidelines. Furthermore, it is paramount to effective matching
                    of work-packages with the neccessary skills and talent. After accomplishing all 
                    these, monitoring and project tracking are inherent to ensuring the successful 
                    completion of a project within the given constraints of cost, quality, and schedule.
                    I'm thrilled to be part of your project team, utilizing allocated resources to 
                    accomplish the desired deliverables.

                    it is not straightforward as many steps are required before 
                    any value can be obtained from raw data. Allow me to

                    Deep learning(DL) is a subset of ML which focus on a certain type of
                    model, Neural Networks which are designed to mimic the functioning of the human brain.
                    Research has proven that with massive datasets for training deep 
                    neural networks, they outperform almost all other types of ML models.
                    Using Tensorflow and Keras, I'll help you develop 
                    end-to-end DL models that can learn complex patterns and identify which features matter the most internally.
