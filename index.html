            <h1>Hi, I'm George</h1>
            <p>I'm a graduate project manager with a keen interest in
                technological advancements of modern age. For the past
                two years I have been on a self-curated path to becoming
                a Data Scientist. It has been quite a challenge but I am 
                enjoying every bit of it. I have acquired some formidabble 
                skills along the way and I'm very enthusiatic towards putting
                them into practice to drive value.

                    Machine Learning models yield no value if they are not 
                    deployed in production environments to provide solutions 
                    they were designed to solve. For tremendous compute power 
                    and smooth integration of these intelligent systems into 
                    business processes, deploying ML models to cloud servers 
                    is the best option. Whether it is Google Cloud Platform,

                     be part of transmuting these models to create value for 
                     different aspects of your operations.

                    With the prevalence of cloud services which tremendously reduces
                    company operating costs, it is paramount that businesses adopt 
                    them or risk closure. The cost of operating in-premises hardware 
                    for compute power and storage services is high and utilizes 
                    precious resources that would have been otherwise directed to 
                    core business objectives. I have the know how and I'm enthusiatic 
                    towards enabling companies take full advantage of the most efficient 
                    cloud services by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
