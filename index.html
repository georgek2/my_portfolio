            <p>I'm a graduate project manager with a keen interest in
                technological advancements of modern age. For the past
                two years I have been on a self-curated path to becoming
                a Data Scientist. It has been quite a challenge but I am 
                enjoying every bit of it. I have acquired some formidable 
                skills along the way and I'm very enthusiastic towards putting
                them into practice to drive value.

                <p>
                    I'm a Project Manager by profession having secured a Bachelor's 
                    degree in Project Planning and Management back in December 2019.
                    In the contemporary business environment, companies have to 
                    undertake continous product modification and develop new ones as 
                    customer needs and preferences shift. Doing these requires first 
                    defining the objective at hand and the expected deliverables at the 
                    end of any business undertaking. In addition, the resource requirement and utilization
                    have to be effectively strategized or a project may end in total failure.
                    <br><br>
                    Planning is crucial to determining the project timeline, budget, scope and 
                    implementation guidelines. Furthermore, it is paramount to effective matching
                    of work-packages with the neccessary skills and talent. After accomplishing all 
                    these, monitoring and project tracking are inherent to ensuring the successful 
                    completion of a project within the given constraints of cost, quality, and schedule.
                    I'm thrilled to be part of your project team, utilizing allocated resources to 
                    accomplish the desired deliverables.

                    With data being regarded as the 'New Oil', companies are 
                    rushing to derive a competitive edge by drawing whatever 
                    insight they can from the data they possess. Unfortunately, 
                    it is not straightforward as many steps are required before 
                    any value can be obtained from datasets having different data 
                    types and originating from various sources. The data has to 
                    be aggregated, cleaned and visualized to enable teams to gain 
                    actionable insights from it. Allow me to be part of your team
                    undertaking end-to-end data science projects to solve different business 
                    problems, utilizing various tools, techniques and technologies.

                    Throughout history, humans have always developed tools, systems, 
                    techniques with the aim of making their work easier, more 
                    effective and efficient. Today, mankind is creating intelligent 
                    assistants using Artificial Intelligence(AI) designed to perform 
                    different tasks across all industries. AI is driving 
                    the fourth industrial revolution fueled by massive amounts of data 
                    gathered by companies today. Machine Learning(ML) is a branch of AI 
                    that is revolutionalizing every industry by making use of BigData, 
                    tools and techniques designed to handle it. I'm skilled in developing
                    a ML project end-to-end and look forward to apply these skills in a real-world
                    business context.

                    Examining your data to identify relevant patterns and 
                    trends is critical to ensure you meet customers' 
                    expectations as well as making informed decisions. 
                    Evidently, companies looking at what their data is 
                    saying and not doing it is creating a huge gap between 
                    poor performing businesses and top achievers across all industries. 
                    Analysing data is a process that starts from collection to cleaning and visualization, 
                    guided by different rules and principles. I find performing data 
                    analysis and visualization with technologies such as Pandas, 
                    Seaborn, Tableu and Excel enjoyable. I'm excited to help you 
                    understand your data by performing comprehensive data analysis.

                    Deep learning(DL) is a subset of ML which focus on a certain type of
                    model, Neural Networks which are designed to mimic the functioning of the human brain.
                    Research has proven that with massive datasets for training deep 
                    neural networks, they outperform almost all other types of ML models.
                    However, despite having the best performance, it is difficult to 
                    interpret their working. No manual feature selection is required in DL 
                    as the network performs the selection process internally without much
                    hyperparameter tuning. Using Tensorflow and Keras, I have developed 
                    dozens of DL models in retail, finance and health which outshines 
                    supervised ML models.

                    If you are still using legacy systems in your business operations, 
                    you are missing out on a lot and risk being outperformed by the 
                    competition. Digitizing core business functions such as data 
                    collection, customer engagement, performance tracking, quality 
                    assurance and financial investing has proven to have huge returns. 
                    In addition, making use of cloud servers is tremendously 
                    cost-effective relative to setting up and maintaining own hardware. 
                    In light of this, allow me to be part of your crucial journey to 
                    cloud migration, whether opting to use AWS, Google Cloud Platform 
                    or Microsoft Azure cloud services.

                    Technology giants and other leading companies have set up massive
                    data centers and server architecture globally, and avail them to 
                    other organizations for relatively low fees. As such, with the prevalence 
                    of cloud services which tremendously reduces
                    company operating costs, it is paramount that businesses adopt 
                    them to compete favorably with others. The cost of operating in-premises hardware 
                    for compute power and storage services is high and utilizes 
                    precious resources that would have been otherwise directed to 
                    core business objectives. I have the capacity and I'm excited 
                    about enabling companies to take full advantage of the most efficient 
                    cloud services by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
